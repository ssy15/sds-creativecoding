POETRY

For this project, I originally wanted to use the Shrek 1 dialogue but ended up not doing it because ... so I chose to pick a random mystery novel in Project Gutenberg called "The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale" by Joseph Conrad. Like I said earlier, I chose this novel randomly so I went online to read the synopsis. It is about a man named Adolf Verloc who first seemed like a normal person who owns a business and has a family but also turns out to be a part of a group of anarchists who believe that the government should be overthrown. I also learned that he is also a Russian spy who wasn't doing so well at his job so his boss asked him to plan a scheme to blow up the Greenwhich Observatory to redeem himself. However, things didn't go as planned so he is faced with the consequences of his actions. 

I think this makes a poem because it could have a deeper meaning behind it. It doesn't have to use as many words to describe emotions, tell a story, or express someone's thougths. Its also important for it to paint a picture in the reader's head to make is easier to understand.

GLITCH ART

For this project, I decided to make it nature-themed because I enjoy looking at the world that surrounds me. 
I think taking pictures of the environment is very inspiring and other people should see and appreciate nature 
since climate change is drastically increasing. I also think that “glitching” the environment is pretty 
cool since it’s not natural for it to happen.

I used three methods we discussed in class—databending where I used different softwares (Audacity, TextEdit, 
and Hex Fiend) to mess with the images; pixel sorting(pixelsort.py) and datamoshing(tomato.py) which are 
both python scripts that I downloaded through GitHub. The pictures I used are from Unsplash and the 
giphs are from GIPHY.

I also posted it on my domain: http://systephanie.com/uncategorized/creative-coding-glitch-art/

SCREENSAVER

  My first idea before this was watercolor splotches appearing on the screen with different soft colors but I 
ended up not working on it because I came up with a different idea. The other design I wanted for my project was
to have dogs present on the screen. I was inspired by this idea because of my love for dogs. I have a 20 month 
old pug and he's the best thing in the world so I thought that it would be cool if I put dogs into screensavers
so I can look at them while I'm at school or work. 

  I created this screensaver with the p5.js editor.(https://p5js.org/) I got a lot of help from Dr. Whalen
because I had a really hard time figuring my code out.
