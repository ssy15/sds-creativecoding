SCREENSAVER

My first idea before this was watercolor splotches appearing on the screen with different soft colors but I ended up not working on it because I came up with a different idea. The other design I wanted for my project was to have dogs present on the screen. I was inspired by this idea because of my love for dogs. I have a 20 month old pug and he's the best thing in the world so I thought that it would be cool if I put dogs into screensavers so I can look at them while I'm at school or work.

I created this screensaver with the p5.js editor.(https://p5js.org/) I got a lot of help from Dr. Whalen because I had a really hard time figuring my code out.
