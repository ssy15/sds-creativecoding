CLOCK

I got my inspiration from Coding Train (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=224&v=E4RyStef-gY). I wanted my clock to look simple and minimalistic. When I think of minimalism, the first thing i think of is this Ted Talk(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBpyNsS-jU) about having less stuff = more happiness. It made me think about how we should focus more on the important things in our lives instead of wasting it on something else. Even though Iâ€™m not really good with managing time, I think the more we use it wisely, the more we can focus on  more meaningful things around us.
