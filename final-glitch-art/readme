For this project, I decided to make it nature-themed because I enjoy looking at the world that surrounds me. 
I think taking pictures of the environment is very inspiring and other people should see and appreciate nature 
since climate change is drastically increasing. I also think that “glitching” the environment is pretty 
cool since it’s not natural for it to happen.

I used three methods we discussed in class—databending where I used different softwares (Audacity, TextEdit, 
and Hex Fiend) to mess with the images; pixel sorting(pixelsort.py) and datamoshing(tomato.py) which are 
both python scripts that I downloaded through GitHub. The pictures I used are from Unsplash and the 
giphs are from GIPHY.

I also posted it on my domain: http://systephanie.com/uncategorized/creative-coding-glitch-art/
