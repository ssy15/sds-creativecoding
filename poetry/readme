For this project, I originally wanted to use the Shrek 1 dialogue but ended up not doing it because ... so I chose to pick a random mystery novel in Project Gutenberg called "The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale" by Joseph Conrad. Like I said earlier, I chose this novel randomly so I went online to read the synopsis. It is about a man named Adolf Verloc who first seemed like a normal person who owns a business and has a family but also turns out to be a part of a group of anarchists who believe that the government should be overthrown. I also learned that he is also a Russian spy who wasn't doing so well at his job so his boss asked him to plan a scheme to blow up the Greenwhich Observatory to redeem himself. However, things didn't go as planned so he is faced with the consequences of his actions. 

I think this makes a poem because it could have a deeper meaning behind it. It doesn't have to use as many words to describe emotions, tell a story, or express someone's thougths. Its also important for it to paint a picture in the reader's head to make is easier to understand.
