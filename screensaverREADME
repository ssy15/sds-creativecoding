SCREENSAVER

  I came up with this idea for my project because of my love for dogs. I have a 20 month old pug and
he's the best thing in the world so I thought that it would be cool if I put dogs into screensavers so 
I can look at them while I'm at school or work. My idea before this was watercolor splotches appearing on
the screen with different soft colors. 

  I created this screensaver with the p5.js editor.(https://p5js.org/) I got a lot of help from Dr. Whalen
because I had a really hard time figuring my code out.
